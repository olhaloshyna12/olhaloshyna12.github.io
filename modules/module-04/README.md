# Module 4 – Structural Design Patterns

This module focused on structural design patterns and their role in organising object-oriented systems in a flexible and maintainable way. The aim was to understand how existing classes and components can be composed and adapted to form larger structures without introducing tight coupling or unnecessary complexity.

The practical work involved the development of a notification system that applied several structural patterns. The Adapter pattern was used to integrate components with incompatible interfaces, enabling them to work together without modifying existing code. The Decorator pattern allowed additional behaviour to be added dynamically at runtime, demonstrating how functionality can be extended without altering the original class structure. The Facade pattern was applied to provide a simplified interface to a more complex subsystem, reducing cognitive load for client code.

This module reinforced the principle of favouring composition over inheritance and demonstrated how structural patterns can significantly improve system modularity. Through this exercise, I gained a clearer understanding of how design patterns support scalable architectures and make systems easier to modify, test, and extend in response to changing requirements.
