# Module 3 – Creational Design Patterns

This module introduced creational design patterns as reusable solutions for managing object creation in object-oriented systems. The focus was on reducing coupling between system components and ensuring that object instantiation does not limit extensibility or maintainability.

The practical exercise explored the use of patterns such as the Factory Method, where object creation logic is abstracted away from client code. Rather than instantiating concrete classes directly, the system relies on abstractions, allowing new object types to be introduced with minimal impact on existing code. This approach reinforces the Open/Closed Principle and supports flexible system evolution.

Through this module, I developed a deeper understanding of how design patterns provide structure and consistency to object-oriented designs. Rather than being theoretical constructs, creational patterns were shown to be practical tools that simplify change management and improve overall design clarity. The exercise also highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate patterns based on context, rather than applying patterns indiscriminately.
