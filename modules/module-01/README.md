# Module 1: Introduction and Recap of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Overview
This module revisited the foundational principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), focusing on encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. These principles underpin scalable, maintainable, and secure software design and form the conceptual foundation for advanced object-oriented development (Mazumdar, 2025).

## Key Concepts and Readings
The unit reviewed classes, objects, constructors, destructors, and access control mechanisms. Emphasis was placed on responsibility-driven class design and how encapsulation supports maintainability and robustness in large-scale systems (Lott, 2021, Chapter 7).

## Class Coding Exercise (Artefact)
**Artefact:** Seminar 1 Task — Vehicle Management System (Python)

The class coding exercise implemented a vehicle management system using an abstract base class and concrete subclasses, reinforcing core object-oriented principles through practical application (University of Essex, 2025).

### OOP Principles Demonstrated
- **Abstraction:** Enforced through an abstract base class defining a shared interface.
- **Inheritance:** Subclasses reused shared behaviour while extending functionality.
- **Encapsulation:** Internal state was protected and accessed via validated methods.
- **Polymorphism:** Subclasses implemented specialised behaviour under a common interface.
- **Composition:** The fleet manager coordinated multiple vehicle objects.

## Challenges and Solutions
A key challenge was avoiding complex conditional logic when handling different vehicle types. This was resolved using abstraction and polymorphism, allowing each subclass to manage its own behaviour. Data integrity was preserved through encapsulation and validation (University of Essex, 2025).

## Reflection on Learning
This module strengthened my ability to translate object-oriented theory into practical design decisions, particularly in relation to responsibility-driven class design and encapsulation (Lott, 2021, Chapter 7). The exercise reinforced how clean abstraction and encapsulation reduce complexity and support extensibility, particularly in larger and security-aware systems (Mazumdar, 2025).

## Contribution to Capstone Project
The design approach established in this module—clear abstractions, protected state, and polymorphic behaviour—provides a reusable foundation for the Capstone Project, supporting scalability and maintainability (Lott, 2021, Chapter 7).
