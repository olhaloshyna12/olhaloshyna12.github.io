# Module 1 – Introduction to Object-Oriented Design

## Learning Focus
Module 1 introduced the foundational concepts of object-oriented programming and responsibility-driven design. The focus was on understanding how abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism support structured, maintainable, and extensible software systems.

## Key Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Artefact
### Vehicle Management System – Object-Oriented Class Hierarchy

This artefact was developed during an in-class seminar exercise facilitated by Professor Anupam Mazumdar. It demonstrates the creation of a simple vehicle management system using a base `Vehicle` class and concrete subclasses such as `Car`, `Bike`, and `Truck`.

The design applies abstraction to define common vehicle behaviour, encapsulation to protect internal state, and inheritance to model “is-a” relationships. Polymorphism allows different vehicle types to be treated uniformly through a shared interface.

## Reflection
This module established a strong foundation for object-oriented thinking by emphasising design structure over simple functionality. Through the seminar exercise, I learned how abstraction helps manage complexity and how encapsulation enforces valid object states. The practical application of inheritance and polymorphism highlighted how object-oriented principles improve code readability, reuse, and extensibility. These concepts formed the basis for later modules focusing on SOLID principles, design patterns, and secure system design.
