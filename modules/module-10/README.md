# Module 10 – Test-Driven Development

This module introduced Test-Driven Development (TDD) as a disciplined approach to software development that places testing at the centre of the design process. Rather than writing tests after implementation, the module emphasised writing tests first to guide design decisions and ensure correctness from the outset.

The practical exercise involved developing functionality incrementally by following the TDD cycle of *write a failing test, implement the minimum code to pass the test, and refactor*. This approach encouraged the creation of small, focused methods and loosely coupled classes, reinforcing key object-oriented principles such as encapsulation and single responsibility.

By writing tests before implementation, design flaws and unclear responsibilities became visible early in the development process. This supported safer refactoring and reduced the risk of introducing defects when modifying existing code. The exercise also demonstrated how automated testing contributes to long-term maintainability and reliability, particularly in systems that evolve over time.

This module highlighted the close relationship between testing and good object-oriented design. TDD was shown not only as a testing strategy, but as a design technique that promotes clarity, confidence, and professional software engineering practice.
