# Olha Aloshyna

## Profile

I am a **Certified Data Science Practitioner** with a strong interdisciplinary background in **data science, software engineering, and biotechnology**. My work sits at the intersection of scientific research and advanced software development, where I design **secure, maintainable, and scalable systems** that support reliable, data-driven decision-making.

Through both professional experience and postgraduate study, I have developed a strong interest in **advanced object-oriented design**, **secure and concurrent programming**, and the application of **software engineering best practices** to data-intensive and AI-enabled systems. I am particularly motivated by building systems that are not only functional, but also robust, testable, and designed for long-term evolution.

## Current Study – University of Essex

**Advanced Object-Oriented Design and Programming (AOODP)**  
*University of Essex — October 2025 to January 2026*

This e-Portfolio documents my academic work across the AOODP module, including practical coding artefacts, seminar exercises, assessed coursework, reflective analysis, and a professional development plan. The work demonstrates my ability to apply advanced object-oriented principles, design patterns, secure coding practices, refactoring techniques, concurrency control, and test-driven development in realistic software scenarios.
